# work-day-scheduler-sevep

## Description

For this challenge it was my job to add to existing html and css and create a javascript file for a work day scheduler. The scheduler displays the current day at the top of the page. The rows of the scheduler are color coded based on the current time of day and whether or not the row is past, present, or future. If you create an item in one of the rows, leave the page and come back, the item persists in the row. It saves to local storage as well. The URL to the deployed page is: https://sevepalattao.github.io/work-day-scheduler-sevep/

## Screenshot

Below is a screenshot of the page with a few example items entered.
